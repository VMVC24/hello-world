# hello-world
An arm and a leg

Wassup new friends,

I'm here because the other room was packed and I heard this is where they keep the good stuff anyways. 

Once and a while I go windowshopping down at the pier looking for a new boat to wreck, but mostly I eat apple slices with nutella from air bnbs I should be splitting with 8 other tennants. It's a lay back life and I do everything I can to keep it from staying that way.
